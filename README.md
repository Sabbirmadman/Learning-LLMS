# 🚀 Learning LLMs: My Journey into AI  

Welcome to my journey of learning and unlocking the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through hands-on projects. Each project showcases a different aspect of LLM implementation, prompt engineering, and practical use cases.  

I will continuously update this repository as I complete more projects! Stay tuned.

## 📌 Project 1: AI Code Explainer  

### 🎯 Overview  
This is my first project, where I built an **AI-powered code explainer**. The goal was to create a tool that takes user-provided code and explains it in a clear and structured manner. This project serves as an **initial step** in understanding how to implement LLMs effectively and craft useful prompts.
