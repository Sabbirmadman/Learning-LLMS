# 🚀 Learning LLMs: My Journey into AI  

Welcome to my journey of learning and unlocking the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through hands-on projects. Each project showcases a different aspect of LLM implementation, prompt engineering, and practical use cases.  

I will continuously update this repository as I complete more projects! Stay tuned.

## 📌 Project 1: AI Code Explainer  

### 🎯 Overview  
This is my first project, where I built an **AI-powered code explainer**. The goal was to create a tool that takes user-provided code and explains it in a clear and structured manner. This project serves as an **initial step** in understanding how to implement LLMs effectively and craft useful prompts.

## 📌 Project 2: Web scrapper and website brochure maker

### 🎯 Overview  
This is my second project, where I built an **AI-powered website brochure maker**. The goal was to create a tool that takes user-provided link and create brochure by scrapping the website. This project serves as an **second step** in understanding how to implement LLMs effectively and craft useful prompts.

### 🛠 Features  
✅ Does basic scrapping of a given website  
✅ Figure out relevent links for the website  
✅ Go throw all the relevent links and create a text based **brochure** for that website.  
✅ Best use case is for companies that want to create their personalised brochure.
