# 🚀 Learning LLMs: My Journey into AI

Welcome to my journey of learning and unlocking the power of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** through hands-on projects. Each project showcases a different aspect of LLM implementation, prompt engineering, and practical use cases.

I will continuously update this repository as I complete more projects! Stay tuned.

## 📌 Project 1: AI Code Explainer

### 🎯 Overview

This is my first project, where I built an **AI-powered code explainer**. The goal was to create a tool that takes user-provided code and explains it in a clear and structured manner. This project serves as an **initial step** in understanding how to implement LLMs effectively and craft useful prompts.

### 🛠 Features

✅ Explains any code snippet provided by the user
✅ Formats the explanation in a **structured and readable** way
✅ Demonstrates **basic prompt engineering** and LLM integration

## 📌 Project 2: Web scrapper and website brochure maker

### 🎯 Overview

This is my second project, where I built an **AI-powered website brochure maker**. The goal was to create a tool that takes user-provided link and create brochure by scrapping the website. This project serves as an **second step** in understanding how to implement LLMs effectively and craft useful prompts.

### 🛠 Features

✅ Does basic scrapping of a given website
✅ Figure out relevent links for the website
✅ Go throw all the relevent links and create a text based **brochure** for that website.
✅ Best use case is for companies that want to create their personalised brochure.

## 📌 Project 3: CSV-Aware RAG System with Langchain, GroqCloud and ChromaDB

### 🎯 Overview

This is my third project, where I built a CSV-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables large-scale data analysis using LangChain, GroqCloud, and ChromaDB—solving a key challenge: analyzing multi-CSV datasets with millions of rows that exceed LLM context limits.

### 🛠 Features

✅ Understands CSV structures – detects columns, data types, and key statistics.
✅ Maps relationships – finds join keys (e.g., employee_id across tables).
✅ Creates smart embeddings – stores metadata in ChromaDB.
✅ Generates pandas code dynamically – LLMs write precise, optimized analytics code from natural language queries.

## 📅 Upcoming Projects

I will be adding more projects covering **advanced LLM applications**, **agentic reasoning**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, and much more!

Stay connected for updates. 🚀
